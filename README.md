# euler library

This is a simple package I wrote to help me with the problems at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

It should be installed locally to be able to run the problems in my [project_euler](https://github.com/jose-ramirez/project_euler) repo.

## tests

Just go to the project root and run `pytest` (it's assumed that you have it installed in your machine already).
